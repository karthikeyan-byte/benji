    <p class="callout-text">The job card had glaring usability issues and needed to be rebuilt for each new placement,
      an inefficiency we hoped to correct. Could we redesign the job card to not only improve usability, but also
      promote consistency and enable powerful testing?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="single-column-section">
    <p>Some of our highest traffic pages, like Suggested Jobs and Search Results, displayed lists of hundreds of job
      cards. The cards gave the user a compact preview of a job and some even allowed users to apply directly with one
      tap.</p>
    <p>Our database is made up of millions of jobs from hundreds of different sources, each returning different data
      than the last. While perfectly formatted jobs exist, a more characteristic job was one with a long title and
      missing information like a logo or perks.</p>

        <p>The overuse of borders and dividers added a lot of visual weight to the page. This extra weight looked even

        <div class="problem-number">8</div>
        <p>The card hadn’t been turned into a component, so reusing it was tedious and inefficient for engineers and a
          contributor to technical debt. This led to inconsistencies in the card across pages. Users could save and
          report jobs on some pages, but not others. </p>

      <div class="problem-with-number last">
        <div class="problem-number">9</div>
        <p>Because of the card’s rigid design, testing <em>which</em> information we showed was time-consuming and
          required significant resources. The job card contents had been the same since its inception with no real
          reason as to why.</p>

    <h2 class="small-caps-header">Research</h2>
    <p>Several of the issues stated above were based on my intuition and understanding of best practices, but others
      came directly from our research. Job seekers who reported jobs cited a lack of information as a top reason.</p>
    <p>After digging in with user interviews, Ben, our research lead, learned that job seekers were frustrated by cut
      off job titles and locations. <strong>They loved our 1-Tap Apply feature, but felt some jobs didn’t have enough
        substance for them to confidently use it.</strong> This was especially true for job seekers in trucking and
      healthcare, as hiring managers in those industries tended to stuff job titles with keywords. </p>

  <div class="callout-container">
    <h2 class="small-caps-header light">Our Vision</h2>
    <p class="callout-text">We aimed to improve the job card&#x27;s usability upfront and systemize the design for added

      implementing reusable components across our product ecosystem.</p>

      <h3>Vertically Spaced &amp; Dynamic Elements</h3>
      <p>Because our job data can be very inconsistent, I designed the job card as it’s own mini system, giving internal
        elements their own full-width vertical space. This allowed each element to dynamically grow or hide depending on
        its contents and the data available to us. It also gave us the flexibility to easily add, reorder, or remove
        internal elements in future tests. </p>

      <h3>Improved Readability</h3>
      <p>The flexible system allowed us to show full job titles and company names by wrapping longer strings. I aligned
        every element to the left for faster scanning and set a clear typographic hierarchy by tweaking font sizes and
        weights for added emphasis on the job’s most important details. </p>

      <h3>Job Card Action Menu</h3>
      <p>Performing actions from the job card had previously been inconsistent. Some cards allowed users to save and
        report jobs, while others only allowed for the dismissal of jobs. I tucked all actions into an expandable menu,
        giving users access to the same actions from every placement. Further, this solution was fluid enough to
        accommodate new actions later on if we needed them.</p>

    <h2 class="small-caps-header">Exploration</h2>
    <p>I started explorations by critically thinking about the <em>types</em> of information that are important to our
      users, but was met with resistance because of time and engineering constraints. I pivoted to restructuring the
      information that was already there in a way that would enable us to easily test contents later. </p>

    <h2 class="small-caps-header">Implementation</h2>
    <p>Working with front-end to implement the new job card exposed holes in our outdated design system process. Because
      of our product organization’s habit of moving quickly and A/B testing everything, many front-end engineers avoided
      spending the time to create and document a component before it actually proved successful. This was reasonable,
      but added to ZipRecruiter’s technical debt. Once a test variant won, we resolved to it quickly and moved on.</p>
    <p>I organized meetings with front-end and design stakeholders to figure out how we could combat this issue. We
      decided to build in time to componentize winning variants and formed a team to take a more wholistic approach to
      improving our design system workflow. I could speak more to how we’re approaching our design system, but I’ll save
      that for another time.</p>
    <p>With a temporary solution in place, I documented the new job card system and helped stress test the component
      before finally testing it with job seekers.</p>

    <h2 class="small-caps-header">Results</h2>
    <p>We tested the new card design on the Suggested Jobs page first and planned to roll it out to other placements
      with a win. The A/B test revealed that the new card design significantly outperformed the old with a <strong>10%
        lift in clicks</strong> and a <strong>6% lift in applications</strong>, a substantial win for what was on the
      surface, a simple visual UI update.</p>
    <p>Based on the agreement we made with front-end, the card was componentized and extended to its different
      placements. It performed similarly in its other placements and <strong>even better on iOS and Android, lifting
        applications by 7% and 8%</strong>, respectively.</p>

    <h2 class="small-caps-header">Summary</h2>
    <p>The job card redesign improved our job seekers’ overall experience by making jobs easier to consume—first on
      Suggested Jobs and later across our entire product suite. Personally, this project gave me some valuable insights:
    </p>
    <p><strong>By systemizing the job card design, I was able to create capabilities</strong> for our product management
      team that would outweigh the initial benefits of simply improving the visual design and hierarchy of the card.</p>
    <p><strong>It’s important to be able to adapt to new constraints and moving targets. </strong>Building products is
      rarely cut and dry. As teams work alongside each other, things can change and that’s okay. Changing my angle from
      what to include to how to include steered the job card to where it is today. </p>
    <p><strong>Communicating well and involving the right stakeholders early on can pay huge dividends.</strong> In the
      process of redesigning the job card, I saw an opportunity to improve the way we utilize design systems. Through
      good communication, I was able to get buy-in and kick off what would be the start of a more mature design system
      process. </p>
