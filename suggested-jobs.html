          To job seekers, ZipRecruiter had long been known as a job search
          engine. While our Suggested Jobs page received a lot of traffic, users
          often complained that they didn’t know why they were being shown
          certain jobs. Our engineering team also had issues with the page,
          adding that it was complex and difficult to run tests on. How could we
          redesign the Suggested Jobs page to give users a stronger sense of
          clarity and control, while also reducing engineering complexity?

      <p class="callout-text">
        Because our Suggested Jobs page shows mixed job content based on search
        and application activity, a stray look into a dream job or a search for
        a friend could instantly dilute a user’s page with seemingly random
        results.

        Mixing job content also proved to be technically challenging. Because of
        the complexity, it was difficult to include other types of job content
        on the page without significant engineering effort. For example, mixing
        in jobs that the user had previously “saved” could take months of
        engineering work. Large A/B tests on Suggested Jobs were constantly
        being descoped or postponed indefinitely. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a company that prides itself on being data-driven, I also found it
        uncharacteristic that we never A/B tested our way into mixing job
        content. We kept this paradigm in place for years based solely on
        outdated assumptions and an initial lack of user feedback.

      <h2 class="small-caps-header">Our Vision</h2>
      <p class="callout-text">
        For ZipRecruiter to become a leader in job <em>matching</em>, we needed
        to help job seekers quickly find jobs they love. We had to ensure
        suggested job content was easily browsable and easily discoverable, and
        the Suggested Jobs page was engineered flexibly for painless future
        iteration.

      <h2 class="small-caps-header light">Features</h2>
      <h3>Grouping Content</h3>
      <p>
        By grouping content into horizontal carousels, users can dive deeper
        into groupings that interest them and easily skip those that don’t. With
        seemingly endless group types to test in the future, I made sure the
        group headers were versatile enough to accommodate whatever we wanted. I
        used subtle cues to differentiate different group types—a square logo to
        accompany groups based on a specific job and an icon in a circle to
        signify a broader group.

      <h3>Controlling Content</h3>
      <p>
        Because group types were partially unpredictable, I had to account for
        various group-level actions. I created a menu component that was
        flexible enough to handle different actions, while also serving as a
        dedicated space for mobile users to read overflow text from longer job
        titles and locations. Including <em>Dismiss</em> and
        <em>Not Interested</em> actions for each group gave users control over
        those that were irrelevant, helping to address their feedback. It also
        gave our matching team another input to improve our algorithms.

        <p>
          In late 2019, we introduced a satisfaction widget on every placement
          that showed job content across the ZipRecruiter ecosystem. It simply
          asked, “Are you satisfied with these job opportunities?” Satisfied
          users dismissed the banner with their selection and unsatisfied users
          were asked a follow up question; “Which of these options best
          describes your answer?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Results collected from the Suggested Jobs page widget over the course
          of several months opened our eyes to the problem.

          In an effort to prioritize a Suggested Jobs page redesign, our team
          followed up by conducting interviews with a panel assembled from
          unsatisfied users. They confirmed our suspicions and gave us
          ammunition to convince product management to move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          After analyzing our direct competitors, I found their suggestion pages
          were basic and uninspired. I decided to approach competitive research
          differently, looking more closely at leaders in the digital content
          space. Products like Netflix and Spotify had elegantly solved a
          similar content problem and helped guide me towards the almighty card
          carousel, a powerful way to organize content.

      <p>
        A Suggested Jobs page redesign presented a massive opportunity for
        ZipRecruiter.
        <strong
          >With over 12% of total job seeker clicks, even small increases in
          engagement would drastically impact total applications</strong
        >—a key action that would drive retention of and revenue from employers
        on the other side of our marketplace. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By creating a flexible system for grouping suggested content, we could
        leverage the high traffic of Suggested Jobs to increase engagement. All
        while unblocking future testing and optimization by untangling code
        complexities in the process.

          I explored a variety of different ways to display groups, trying out
          single-row card carousels, list views, multi-row card carousels, mini
          carousels, and more. I liked a version of the list view and the mini
          carousels as options to test against the more obvious single-row card
          carousel, but was constrained by engineering resources, a recent job
          card redesign, and our compressed timeline.

          Group headers had to be dynamic, so as part of my process, I worked

          I also iterated on how group actions could work, mocking up fly-out
          menus, bottom drawer menus, and inline actions. We settled on the
          fly-out menu on desktop and the bottom drawer menu on mobile because
          of their simplicity and flexibility.

          After gathering feedback from my team and showing Nishok the options,
          we narrowed in on the single-row card carousel and I began iterating
          on the carousel micro-interactions for both desktop and mobile. I
          prototyped and tweaked specifics like paging versus scrolling, dismiss
          group animations, and menu entrance and exit animations (shown above

        After working closely with engineering to bring the designs to life, we
        launched the test and crossed our fingers. At the project’s inception,
        we documented two primary indicators of success; higher engagement and
        improved satisfaction. Fortunately, our users found the experience more
        engaging and satisfying than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >We increased clicks on Suggested Jobs by 22%, applications by 8%, and
          unique users who engaged with Suggested Jobs by 10%. We also lifted
          satisfaction by 8%.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        A win of this magnitude meant not only rolling the designs out to all of
        our web users, but also clearing the way for our team to test new
        groups, create a system for how to order groups, and expand the designs
        to iOS and Android.

      <h2 class="small-caps-header">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        By listening to our users and making changes that provided real value to
        them, we created a dynamic Suggested Jobs page with drastically improved
        testing capabilities. I grew as a designer and walked away with a few
        key takeaways:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>There is always value in listening to user feedback. </strong
        >Even if you already know a problem exists, user feedback can help you
        narrow in on the nuances and can be used to help get the rest of your
        organization on board. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Identifying and pursuing low-hanging fruit can be very… fruitful. </strong
        >Early in the discovery phase, I thought the problem was too obvious for
        no one to have tried to solve it yet, but I continued forward and
        learned that, in fact, it was a big problem and a massive opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Thinking and designing with a systems mindset is a great way to
          achieve flexibility. </strong
        >All we really did was turn a grid layout into grouped rows, but by
        utilizing systems thinking on each level (groups, headers, menus), we
        created a solution that enabled our product management team to broadly
        test large-scale hypotheses, while saving our engineering and design
        teams time.
